# Tasks
The first app developed for Sairama. Tasks can be created and stored in cloud Firestore.
Teams can be created with members in it.
Tasks can be shared to team members.
Team members can comment on the tasks shared.
Firebase Cloud Messaging is implemented so that notifications are received for:
  1. New shared Task
  2. Comments are updated by a team member for a shared Task.
